        /* TO DO:
        * Given a list of integers, use the Stream API to filter out even numbers, square the remaining numbers, and return the sum of the squared numbers.

        * Given a list of strings, use the Stream API to filter out strings that have a length greater than 5, convert the remaining strings to uppercase, and return a new list of the modified strings.

        * Given a list of strings, use the Stream API to group the strings by their length, and return a map where the keys are the lengths and the values are lists of strings with that length.

        * Given a list of strings, use the Stream API to group the strings by their first letter, and return a map where the keys are the first letters and the values are lists of strings that start with that letter.

        * Given a list of people, use the Stream API to group the people by their age, and return a map where the keys are the ages and the values are lists of people with that age.

        * Given a list of strings, use the Stream API to filter out strings that have a length less than 4, reverse the remaining strings, and return a new list of the modified strings.

        * Given a list of people, use the Stream API to filter out people who are older than 40, sort the remaining people by their age in descending order, and return a new list of the modified people.
